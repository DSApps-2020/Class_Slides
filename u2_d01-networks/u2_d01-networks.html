# Networks Overview

---

## A Network

A network, is comprised of:

- Nodes (vertices, points, actors), joined together in pairs by
- Edges (links, connections, ties)

Many types of networks:

- Physical networks: telephone lines, roads, airline routes, rivers
- Information networks: WWW, citation networks
- Social networks: Facebook, Twitter, but not just: this class, Marriage between Royal Houses
- Biological networks: "food webs" (what eats what?), metabolical networks

## Networks Properties

- Directed/Not: Do the edges have orientation?
- Weighted edges/Not: Do the edges have weight/strength/length?
- Connected/Not: Can you "get to" any node from any node?
- Self-edges/Not: Can a node be linked to itself?
- Acyclic/Not: Are there cycles? Can you get from one node to itself not by a self-loop?
- Time-varied/Not: Does the network change over time?

## Typical Questions About Networks

### Macro:

- Is the network connected?
- Is the network dense or sparse?
- What is the maximum/average shortest path? .font80percent[small world effect]
- Is the network homophilic for attribute X?
- Are there interesting communities in the network?
- Will a "message" percolate through the whole network? How fast?
- Can we model the network to give insight on how it developed? Predict how it *will* develop?

# The Adjacency Matrix

---

## Undirected Networks

The Adjacency matrix `\(A\)` of an unweighted network is defined as a `\(n\times n\)` matrix with elements `\(A_{ij}\)` such that:

`$$A_{i,j} =
 \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \mbox{if there is an edge between nodes}\ i \mbox{ and}\ j \\
   0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}$$`

- The adjacency of a simple undirected network would be symmetric and contain only zeros on its diagonal
- If the network has multiedges - if there are `\(q\)` edges between elements `\(i\)` and `\(j\)` - then `\(A_{ij} = q\)`
- If the network has self-edges - if there is an edge between element `\(i\)` and itself - then `\(A_{ii} = 2\)` (useful convention)
---

So this unweighted, undirected network:

&lt;img src="images/Simple-Graph-1.png" width="30%" /&gt;

Would be represented as `\(A_{5\times 5}\)`:

`\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\end{bmatrix}\)`

---

For an undirected *weighted* network, `\(A_{ij}\)` would contain the weight.
- The higher the weight - the stronger the connection
- (In absolute value - because a weight needs not be positive)

&lt;img src="images/Weighted-Graph-1.png" width="30%" /&gt;

`\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0.2 &amp; 0.4 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0.2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0.1 \\0.4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0.1 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\end{bmatrix}\)`

---

## Directed Networks (a.k.a DiGraph)

The Adjacency matrix `\(A\)` of an unweighted network is defined as a `\(n\times n\)` matrix with elements `\(A_{ij}\)` such that:

`$$A_{i,j} =
 \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \mbox{if there is an edge from node}\ j \mbox{ to node}\ i \\
   0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}$$`

Note the convention from *column* index to *row* index can be confusing.

---

So this unweighted, directed network:

&lt;img src="images/Directed-Graph-1.png" width="30%" /&gt;

Would be represented as `\(A_{5\times 5}\)`:

`\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\end{bmatrix}\)`

---

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

- If the network is directed and has no cycles, it is possible to draw the network such that all edges point downward, from a higher-numbered node into a lower-numbered node.
- If the network can be drawn where any edge from `\(j\)` to `\(i\)` implies that `\(j &gt; i\)`, its adjacency matrix is *upper triangular*
- Since the diagonal contains only zeros (why) it is *strictly traingular*
- The other direction also holds (iff)

Is the netwok from previous page acyclic? Try both directions.

---

For example, this acyclic network can be numbered so that its adjacency matrix is strictly triangular:

&lt;img src="images/DAG-1.png" width="30%" /&gt;

Would be represented as `\(A_{5\times 5}\)`:

`\(\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\end{bmatrix}\)`

# Bipartite Networks

---

## Incidence Matrix

We can write an Adjacency Matrix for a Bipartite Network (a.k.a *Two-Mode Network*) but a more compact representation exists: the Incidence Matrix.

If `\(n\)` items belong to `\(g\)` groups, the incidence matrix representing this bipartite network is `\(B_{g\times n}\)` with elements `\(B_{ij}\)` such that:

`$$B_{i,j} =
 \begin{cases}
   1 &amp; \mbox{if item}\ j \mbox{ belongs to group}\ i \\
   0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}$$`
 
---

So this unweighted, undirected bipartite network of 5 items belonging to 4 groups:

&lt;img src="images/Bipartite-Network-1.png" width="30%" /&gt;

Would be represented as `\(B_{4\times 5}\)`:

`\(\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\end{bmatrix}\)`

---

## Bipartite Networks Projections

We can manually "project" a two-mode `\(g\)` groups x `\(n\)` items network into a one-mode undirected unweighted network of only `\(g\)` groups or only `\(n\)` items:

- If two items share a group - draw an edge between them.
- If two groups share an item - draw an edge between them.

&lt;img src = "images/bipartite_projections.png" style = "width: 100%"&gt;

---

However, this representation results in a loss of information.

For example, we could add for each pair of items (groups) how many groups (items) they share, with a weighted edge:

&lt;img src = "images/bipartite_projections_weighted.png" style = "width: 100%"&gt;

What does it mean in terms of incidence matrix `\(B\)`?

---

Exploiting the fact that `\(B\)` contains only zeros and ones, the number of groups shared by two items `\(i\)` and `\(j\)`, i.e. their *weight*:

`\(w(i, j) = \sum_{k=1}^{g} B_{ki}B_{kj} = \sum_{k=1}^{g} B^\intercal_{ik}B_{kj}\)`

And if we treat `\(w(i, j)\)` as elements of matrix `\(P_{n\times n}\)` we could write:

`\(P = B^\intercal B\)`

And `\(P\)` is *almost* the adjacency matrix of the items graph we've manually built. On its diagonal for each item `\(i\)` there is the total number of groups it belongs to:

`\(P_{ii} = w(i, i) = \sum_{k=1}^{g} B_{ki}B_{ki} = \sum_{k=1}^{g} B^2_{ki} = \sum_{k=1}^{g} B_{ki}\)`

And so, if we wanted a proper weighted adjacency matrix, we would need to put zeros on `\(P\)`'s diagonal.

How would we reach the `\(P'_{g\times g}\)` adjacency matrix of the groups network?

# Degree and Density

---

## Undirected Networks

The degree of a node in an undirected unweighted network is the number of edges connected to it (NOT number of its neighbors!).

The weighted degree of a node in an undirected weighted network is the sum of edges weights connected to it.

In terms of adjacency matrix `\(A\)`:

`\(deg(i) = k_i = \sum_{i=1}^n A_{ij}\)`

.insight[
💡 Does this definition work for networks with multiedges or self-edges?
]

---

For an unweighted network: if `\(m\)` is the number of edges, there are `\(2m\)` ends of edges. This is also the sum of the nodes degrees:

`\(2m = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i = \sum_{ij}A_{ij}\)`

.insight[
💡 How would you define `\(m\)` to make this definition "work" for a weighted network?
]

This means that the average degree `\(c\)` of an unweighted undirected network is:

`\(c = \frac{2m}{n}\)`

---

The *density* of a network is defined as the fraction of existing edges from potential edges:

`\(\rho = \frac{m}{n\choose 2} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\)`

Which means the density for large networks is roughly the ratio of average degree to network size:

`\(\rho = \frac{c}{n-1} \propto \frac{c}{n}\)`

- If we could prove somehow that as `\(n\to\infty\)` `\(\rho\to 0\)`, we'd call such network *sparse*. Alternatively, if `\(\rho\)` remains non-zero, we'd call such a network *dense*
- We can write `\(c=\rho n\)`. For some networks the average degree does not change. This means that as `\(n\)` grows `\(\rho\)` shrinks at rate `\(1/n\)`, and the network is called *extremely sparse*

.insight[
💡 Think of an example of a network for which the average degree should remain constant as `\(n\)` grows.
]

---

## Directed Networks

When adding directions to edges, we talk about the *in-degree* and *out-degree* of a node, as the number of ingoing or outgoing edges connected to it:

`\(k^{\text{in}}_i = \sum^{n}_{j=1}A_{ij}\quad k^{\text{out}}_j = \sum^{n}_{i=1}A_{ij}\)`

The number of edges `\(m\)` equals the sum of in- or out-degrees:

`\(m = \sum^{n}_{i=1}k^{\text{in}}_i = \sum^{n}_{j=1}k^{\text{out}}_j = \sum^{n}_{ij}A_{ij}\)`

The average in-degree is the average out-degree:

`\(c_{\text{in}} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{i=1}k^{\text{in}}_i = \frac{1}{n}\sum^{n}_{j=1}k^{\text{out}}_j = c_{\text{out}}\)`

---

This means that the average degree `\(c\)` of an unweighted directed network is:

`\(c = \frac{m}{n}\)`

Which means the definition of density `\(\rho\)` remains the same for directed networks **in terms of average degree**:

`\(\rho = \frac{m}{n(n-1)} = \frac{c}{n-1}\)`

---

### Example: The Marvel Cinematic Universe Characters Network

Let's convert the weighted undirected adjacency matrix `\(P\)` into unweighted:


```python
P[P &gt; 0] = 1
P[:4, :4]
```

```
## array([[0, 1, 1, 1],
##        [1, 0, 1, 1],
##        [1, 1, 0, 1],
##        [1, 1, 1, 0]], dtype=int64)
```

Get the list of degrees:


```python
k = P.sum(axis=0)
k
```

```
## array([14, 14, 10, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 13, 14, 13, 13, 13, 13,  1],
##       dtype=int64)
```

---

No. of nodes `\(n\)`:


```python
n = P.shape[0]
m = np.triu(P).sum()
print('n nodes: %d; m edges: %d' % (n, m))
```

```
## n nodes: 16; m edges: 101
```

Average degree:


```python
k.mean()
```

```
## 12.625
```

See that the simple definition is equivalent:


```python
2 * m / n
```

```
## 12.625
```

---

Density `\(\rho\)`:


```python
k.mean() / (n - 1)
```

```
## 0.8416666666666667
```

We can see that most characters are connected to most characters (16 overall). One character, however, is connected to only 1 character:


```python
characters = marvel.columns[1:]
characters[np.argmin(k)]
```

```
## 'Captain Marvel'
```

is connected with:


```python
characters[np.argmax(P[np.argmin(k), :])]
```

```
## 'Nick Fury'
```

# Walks and Paths

---

### Unweighted, Directed and Undirected Networks

A *walk* in a network is a route from node A to node B along the edges.

A *path* is a walk which does not intersect itself.

Walks and paths are extremely important in algorithms answering questions regarding a network's structure and the flow of information it. Of particular importance is the *shortest path* between two nodes.

Shortest?

---

The *length* of a walk/path of an unweighted network is the number of edges traversed along the walk (NOT number of nodes!)

For example, exploiting the fact that `\(A\)` contains only zeros and ones, we can easily compute the number of all walks of length 2 between two nodes:

`\(N^{(2)}_{ij} = \sum^n_{k=1}A_{ik}A_{kj}={[A^2]_{ij}}\)`

(the `\(ij\)`-th element of the "squared" matrix `\(A^2\)`)

Similarly the number of walks of length 3 between two nodes:

`\(N^{(3)}_{ij} = \sum^n_{k,l=1}A_{ik}A_{kl}A_{kj}={[A^3]_{ij}}\)`

And in general, the number of walks of length `\(r\)` between two nodes:

`\(N^{(r)}_{ij} = {[A^r]_{ij}}\)`

---

## Shortest Paths

The shortest path (a.k.a *geodesic path*) between two nodes is the path of minimum length between the two nodes.

The *shortest distance* (a.k.a *geodesic distance*) is the length of the shortest path, in other words the smallest value of `\(r\)` such that `\({[A^r]_{ij}} &gt; 0\)`.

.insight[
Why is it not called "the shortest walk"? Must it be unique?

What is the shortest distance between nodes which are not connected?
]

The *diameter* of a network is the maximal shortest distance between any pair of nodes.

.insight[
What is the meaning of the diameter in networks we've seen?

# Components

---

## Undirected Networks

- Some parts of a network are disconnected from each other
- A *component* is a subset of nodes such that there exists at least one path between each pair of nodes in the subset
- No other node in the network can be added and preserve this property
- A singleton node is a single component
- A network in which every pair of nodes are connected, has a single component and is said to be *connected*
- The adjacency matrix of a disconnected network *can be* written in block diagonal form

.insight[
How many components are there in the Sci-Fi books network? Is it connected?

What is an easy way of making the network "more" or "less" connected?
]

---

## Directed Networks

Type I Definition:
- *weakly connected* components: a subset of nodes such that there exists at least one directed path between each pair of nodes in the subset, direction can be either way
- *strongly connected* components: a subset of nodes such that there exists at least one directed path between each pair of nodes, in both direction

&lt;img src = "images/Strongly-CC.png" style = "width: 30%"&gt;

---

Type II Definition:
- *out-component* of node `\(i\)`: subset of all nodes reacheable by a directed path from node `\(i\)` including `\(i\)` itself
- *in-component* of node `\(i\)`: subset of all nodes from which node `\(i\)` can be reached by a directed path, including `\(i\)` itself

&lt;img src = "images/In_Out_Components.png" style = "width: 30%"&gt;

.font80percent[
The out-component of node 2 (or 1, or 3) is {1, 2, 3, 5}.

The in-component of node 2 (or 1, or 3) is {1, 2, 3}

# The Graph Laplacian

---

### Undirected, Weighted and Unweighted Networks

A different matrix representation of a network which proves useful in many situations is the Laplacian `\(L_{n\times n}\)`:

`$$L_{i,j} =
 \begin{cases}
    k_i &amp; \mbox{if } i = j \\
   -1 &amp; \mbox{if } i \neq j \mbox{ and there is an edge between nodes}\ i \mbox{ and}\ j \\
   0 &amp; \mbox{otherwise}
 \end{cases}$$`

Where `\(k_i\)` is node `\(i\)`'s degree as defined before.

In other words:

`\(L_{ij}=k_i\delta_{ij}-A_{ij}\)`

Where `\(\delta_{ij}\)` is the *Kronecker delta*, which is 1 if `\(i = j\)` and 0 otherwise.

---

In other words:

`\(L = D - A\)`

Where `\(A\)` is defined as before, and `\(D\)` the diagonal matrix with nodes degrees along the diagonal.
